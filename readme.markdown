UIAppearance sample for Xamarin Xaminar, 28th June 2012
=========

This sample shows how you can take a normal, unstyled app and easily change basic items (eg the tint color) and more advanced items (eg UINavigationBar) easily.

* Resources for this came from [Glyphish](http://glyphish.com). Non-retina graphics are not includes, as the license does not allow it.

* The header and tabbar images come from [AppDesignVault.com](http://www.appdesignvault.com/). Definitely worth getting if you don't have a designer.
